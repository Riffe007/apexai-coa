## 🚀 Features
- **Hybrid Model Framework**: Combines DCGAN, Bayesian Networks, Gaussian Smoothing, and Ensemble Learning for robust scenario generation and analysis.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Uses RLHF and Deep Q-Learning for optimal decision-making.
- **Multi-Modal Data Processing**: Seamlessly integrates text, tabular, and image data.
- **Federated Learning**: Ensures secure and distributed data processing across stakeholders.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Transparency through SHAP, LIME, and SageMaker Clarify integrations.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with AWS tools such as S3, SageMaker, Bedrock, OpenSearch, and EKS for cloud-based scalability.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Utilizes DCGAN/CTGAN for generating realistic yet synthetic business scenarios.
- **Data Lakehouse**: Centralized data storage and querying using S3 and Athena.
